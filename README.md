# BRUTUS

## What is BRUTUS?
Brutus is a way to ensure that one's property is safe and sound. It is a smart bike lock attachment that allows bikers to elevate their confidence in the safety of their mode of transportation with the ability to remotely monitor and secure their bikes.

When someone is messing with the bike, the bike owner is alerted via push notifications and can then monitor their bike from a live video feed. This way, the owner can easily identify/describe a intruder if anything off the bike is stolen.
